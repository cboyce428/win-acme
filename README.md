# Project status
win-acme has not been maintained since June 2024. The long term maintainer [@WouterTinus](https://github.com/WouterTinus) has decided to focus his efforts on a cross platform version of the program called [simple-acme](https://github.com/simple-acme/simple-acme/), that is fully backwards compatible with win-acme. This repository is still monitored for bug reports, but no further code updates or releases are expected.
